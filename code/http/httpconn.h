 * Description  : This file contains the declaration of the HttpConn class, which is designed 
 *                for managing an HTTP connection. It uses the Buffer class as a buffer for IO 
 *                with sockets and employs the HttpRequest class and HttpResponse class to parse 
 *                and construct HTTP messages. It encapsulates methods for reading, writing, 
 *                processing, and responding to HTTP requests.
